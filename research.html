      <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Warwick, with
	      a final-year research project on point symmetries of crystallographic
	      defects in diamond.</p>
      <p>I moved to Imperial College London for my postgraduate study. In my
	      master's degree I undertook a research project on optimising x-ray flux
	      from high-harmonic generation.</p>
      <p>I completed my PhD in the astrophysics group, working on understanding
        substructure in protoplanetary discs - specifically those with large scale
        asymmetries - and using hydrodynamics and/or radiative transfer simulations
        to explain them.</p>

      <p><b>Highlights</b></p>
      <p>I showed that the accretion luminosity from a growing planetary embryo can lead
        to the formation of an anticyclonic vortex.</p>

        <p>Snapshots of the gas surface density, overlaid with gas velocity streamlines.</p>

      <p>The anticyclonic vortex traps dust in both the radial and azimuthal directions,
      creating non-axisymmetric substructure, similar to those in observations.</p>

        <p>Snapshots of the gas surface density (left), vortensity (centre) and dust
          surface density (right). A local maximum can be seen in  the gas surface density,
          where the velocity streamlines reveal the anticyclonic vortex structure. A
          local minimum in vortensity can be seen at this location. The dust surface density
          shows the trapping of dust in the vortex.</p>
      </div>

      <p>I showed that the vortex, which forms around the planet, enhances the accretion rate
        onto the embryo, and thus leads to more massive planetary cores.</p>
