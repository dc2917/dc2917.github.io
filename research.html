      <p>I completed my undergraduate studies in physics at the University of
        Warwick, with a final-year research project on point symmetries of
        crystallographic defects in diamond.</p>
      <p>I moved to Imperial College London for my postgraduate study in
        physics. In my master's degree I undertook a research project on
        optimising x-ray flux from high-harmonic generation.</p>
      <p>I completed my PhD in the astrophysics group, working on understanding
        substructure in protoplanetary discs - specifically those with large
        scale asymmetries - and using hydrodynamics and/or radiative transfer
        simulations to explain them.</p>

      <p><b>Highlights</b></p>
      <p>I showed that the accretion luminosity from a growing planetary embryo
        can lead to the formation of an anticyclonic vortex.</p>

        <p>Snapshots of the gas surface density, overlaid with gas velocity
          streamlines.</p>
      </div>

      <p>The anticyclonic vortex traps dust in both the radial and azimuthal
        directions, creating non-axisymmetric substructure, similar to those in
        observations.</p>

        <p>Snapshots of the gas surface density (left), vortensity (centre) and
          dust surface density (right). A local maximum can be seen in the gas
          surface density, where the velocity streamlines reveal the
          anticyclonic vortex structure. A local minimum in vortensity can be
          seen at this location. The dust surface density shows the trapping of
          dust in the vortex.</p>
      </div>

      <p>I showed that the vortex, which forms around the planet, enhances the
        accretion rate onto the embryo, and thus leads to more massive planetary
        cores.</p>

        <p>Filled symbols show the final planet mass reached when including the
          thermal feedback from the planetary embryo's accretion luminosity,
          while open symbols show the mass reached without. The thermal feedback
          on the disc from the accretion luminosity allows the core to grow
          beyond what would otherwise be permitted.</p>
