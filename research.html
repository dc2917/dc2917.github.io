      <p>I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Warwick, with
	a final-year research project on point symmetries of crystallographic
	defects in diamond.</p>
      <p>I moved to Imperial College London for my postgraduate study. In my
	master's degree I undertook a research project on optimising x-ray flux
	from high-harmonic generation. I am now a PhD student in the astrophysics
	group, working on understanding substructure in protoplanetary discs -
	specifically those with large scale asymmetries, and using hydrodynamics
	and/or radiative transfer simulations to explain them.
